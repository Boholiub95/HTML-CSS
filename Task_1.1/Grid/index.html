        The holy grail is a web page layout which has multiple, equal height columns that are
        defined with style sheets. It is commonly desired and implemented, but for many years, the
        various ways in which it could be implemented with available technologies all had
        drawbacks.[1] Because of this, finding an optimal implementation was likened to searching
        for the elusive Holy Grail. The limitations of CSS and HTML, the desirability of
        semantically meaningful pages that rank well in search engines, and the deficiencies of
        various browsers combined historically to create a situation in which there was no way to
        create this type of layout that would be considered totally correct. As the underlying
        technologies did not provide a proper solution, web designers found various ways to work
        around the limitations. Common workarounds included changes in page structure, the addition
        of graphics, scripting, and the creative use of CSS. These methods were imperfect,
        inconvenient, and considered by some to be abuse of the web standards and their intent. More
        recent web standards have provided much more complete and robust solutions for implementing
        this layout. In particular, the CSS Flexible Box Layout and CSS Grid Layout modules have
        both provided full solutions.
